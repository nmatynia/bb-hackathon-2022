# EnerSight
## About
Green energy app that enables users to track their photofoltanics and wind power sources.  
The project originated at **hackathon** called BB Days 4 IT 2022.  
There is also a backend wrote specifically for this project, you can find it [here](https://github.com/marcinbohm/hackatonBB-backend)
## For who?
The app is targeted both to companies and people.
## How?
The idea is simple, regular people can check on the map how much an installation would cost,  
how much energy it would produce each month and when the invesment will pay off.  

Companies on the other hand have much more indepth look into the statistics of their clients.  
They can manage their resources by adding/removing/editing the pins on the map.
